"A Keysight Vee program for the 8753/8720 family of vector network analyzers that outlines the use "
"of *OPC? and NUMG (or number of  groups) to coordinate and synchronize end of sweep when averaging "
"is activated within the analyzer. Be advised that there are MANY  subtleties within the program "
"related to the operation of the analyzer. If the unit is set to anything OTHER than a full 2-port"
"calibration then the unit will sweep 1x (forward for S11 and/or S21) for each average. "
"If the product of the (sweep time + trigger rearm + latency) and the NUMG (number of GROUPS) for "
"that specific set up  is greater than the system controller time out setting, then an HPIB time-out"
"error will occur. This condition is amplified when a FULL 2-Port calibration is activated due to "
"the fact that a triggered sweep requires both a forward AND reverse sweep, thus the effective "
"sweep time delay (and trigger rearm and latency) is doubled. To circumvent this problem the user "
"can either increase the GPIB card time out setting, add a WAIT statement before the READ x, or USE "
"the SRQ/SPOLL to entirely avoid this issue. While the first two recommendations are programmer "
"friendly they are EXTREMELY inefficient, and depend on delays that are inconsistent between version"
"of analyzer and analyzer setups. The increase time out and delay approaches are considered POOR "
"programming practice. It is recommend the SRQ bit be masked and an SPOLL detected."
