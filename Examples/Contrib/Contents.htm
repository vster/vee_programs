    binary as two 8-bit bytes; the most significant byte is sent first, followed

    The measurement units (M) format transfers trace data as ASCII integer 
    values in measurement units, which is the internal format used by the 
    spectrum analyzer. See Figure 5-8 on page 305. The displayed amplitude of 
    each element falls on one of 601 vertical points (with the 601st equal to 
    the reference level). For example, the peak of the signal in Figure 5-8 on 
    page 305 is equal to -10 dBm, or one division below the reference level. 
    This is equal to 540 measurement units (600 measurement units at the 
    reference level, less 60 measurement units for one division down, equals 540 
    measurement units). There are also ten additional points of overrange. 
    Measurement units range from 0 to 610.&nbsp; A line feed (ASCII code 10) 
    follows data output. The end-or-identify message (EOI) is sent with a line 
    feed.&nbsp; The M-format is faster than the P-format, but most applications 
    will require computer conversion to parameter units. Also, because the
