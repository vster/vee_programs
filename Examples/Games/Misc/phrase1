Pain in the neck
You're pulling my leg
You can't take it with you
Some people's kids
First Down and ten
Been there done that
The early bird gets the worm
A stitch in time saves nine
Take my wife please
You sunk my battleship
Follow the yellow brick road
Beam me up scotty
A Piece of the action
Jump the Gun
Easy come easy go
Don't cry over spilt milk
Brush your teeth before you go to bed
Early to bed early to rise
Just Say no
Keep your hands to yourself
Don't let the bed bugs bite
Good things come to those that wait
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Don't take any wooden nickles
Good things come in small packages
It takes one to know one
Who's minding the fort?
I know you are, but what am I?
See ya later alligator
Time is money
Time heals all wounds
A rolling stone gathers no moss
It's water under the bridge
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Blood is thicker than water
Time flies when you're having fun
Wait 'til your father gets home
