Under the bridge
Over the Rainbow
Ground Zero
Behind the Iron Curtain
On top of old smokey
Between the sheets
Under the Hood
Between your ears
Edge of the universe
End of your nose
Tip of the iceberg
Bottom of the ocean
Land of Oz
Inside the house
On top of the world
The neighborhood pub
The Sunny Side of the street
Across Town from easy street
The Wrong side of the tracks
Where the grass is greener
Behind the eight ball
Under the boardwalk
Behind the bleachers
Behind Door Number Three
Armpit of the world
Bottom of the barrel
On cloud nine
In the freezer section
Bottom of your shoe
Crook of your neck
In fine stores everywhere
Where the buffalo roam
