"PURPOSE:\t To illustrate use of a Toggle Button to create a One-Shot Button."
"" "USER INPUT REQUIRED:  Before pressing RUN, click on the two Toggle Buttons "
"             and observe the connected Counters.  Then, press RUN and"
"             again click on the Toggle buttons, observing that only the"
"             \"Complete\" method still works." ""
"EXPLANATION: Often, it is desirable to add a click button to a Panel (such as"
"             the Info About button you pressed to see this text) in a program."
"             Since the Toggle object is normally considered as a source of data"
"             (0 or 1) depending on it\'s current state, it would not appear to"
"             be the best candidate for such a job." ""
"             The first attempt is usually to add a START button to the panel so"
"             that the hosted thread will run whenever the user presses the"
"             START button.  However, ALL start buttons are \"pressed\" when the"
"             user selects RUN from the titlebar which is often not the desired"
"             action.  If you use the OK/Confirm button to control a hosted"
"             thread, it works only after RUN has been pressed, since it has no"
"             AutoExecute mode." ""
"             The solution to the problem is to use a Data ==> Toggle Control ==> Button "
"             with a Reset Control input, and an If/Then/Else object.  The Toggle has"
"             Auto Execute enabled so it will operate before RUN has been pressed."
"             Since Auto Execute mode does not work when any other thread is"
"             operating, we need a way to continually have the output of the"
"             Toggle sent to the If/Then/Else test; Until Break queries the "
"             Toggle from the time RUN is pressed until the program"
"             stops.  A side effect is that although other threads may"
"             eventually stop, the Until Break continues to run until either"
"             Stop is pressed or until a Stop object is executed by one of the"
"             threads.  " ""
"             You can look at the examples, trying out each one both before and"
"             after the RUN button has been pressed to run all threads. Consider"
"             how you might use several Toggle One-Shots in a single program,"
"             having each perform a different task, and having them operate both"
"             with and without a RUN action." "")))
